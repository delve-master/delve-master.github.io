layout: post
title: Choosing which post to be visble

If you want to hide certain posts from being seen by the public, you can add the  `published` tag to the front matter of posts.

Refer to the code below:

```yaml
layout: post
title: your_title
...
...
published: false  # set this to true if you are publishing it
```

Posts with the `published` tag set to `false` will be invisible.
